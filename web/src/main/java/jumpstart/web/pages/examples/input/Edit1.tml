	<h1>Edit (Using BeanEditForm) (1)</h1>
	
	This page shows how a simple <strong>BeanEditForm</strong> component in the template results in a multi-line editing
	form for an object - in this example the object is Person 1 from the database.  Tapestry's BeanEditForm component 
	magically displays the Person for edit.  We've complicated it a little by using <code>p:</code> to 
	override person's version field, but <code>p:</code> is easy to use.<br/><br/>
	
	<t:beaneditform t:id="person" object="person" submitLabel="Save">[BeanEditForm here]
		<!-- Hide the version field.  We don't want version field to be editable, but it must be in 
			the form to prevent it being updated/refreshed in onActivate(), which would defeat optimistic locking. -->
		<p:version>
			<t:hidden value="person.version"/>
		</p:version>
 	</t:beaneditform><br/>

	<a t:type="actionlink" t:id="refresh" href="#">Refresh</a><br/><br/>

	The Person was retrieved from the database by PersonService, which is an EJB3 Session Bean, using the definition 
	stored in Person, which is an EJB3 Entity Bean. PersonService is also responsible for saving the changed person.<br/><br/>
	
	Obviously, BeanEditForm is ideal for rapid prototyping, but it can be used for more than that because its parameters 
	let you exclude fields, include fields, reorder fields, etc. The styling can be overridden with CSS. Individual properties 
	can be overridden via <code>p:</code>, just as we've done here to hide person.version.<br/><br/>
	
	Another way to hide fields is to annotate them with <code>@NonVisual</code>.  However, never use <code>@NonVisual</code> 
	on a version field unless you are abandoning optimistic locking!  <code>@NonVisual</code> prevents the field going out to 
	the form and back.  For an example of the danger, when this page is submitted Tapestry first calls onActivate() which 
	refreshes our detached _person from the database.  Tapestry then overwrites the fields in _person with the fields from our 
	form - this would not include version if it was marked @NonVisual. The entity may have been updated by someone else but you 
	won't be told.<br/><br/>
