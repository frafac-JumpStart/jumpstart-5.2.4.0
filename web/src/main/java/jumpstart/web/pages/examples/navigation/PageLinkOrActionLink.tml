	<h1>PageLink Or ActionLink?</h1>
	
	There are several criteria to consider when choosing between PageLink and ActionLink for a particular job:<br/><br/>
	
	<strong>PageLink</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Plus:</strong> Simple to code, requiring no Java.</li>
		<li><strong>Plus:</strong> Generates a render request, so it does only 1 trip to the server.</li>
		<li><strong>Minus:</strong> Context is baked in when the link is rendered.</li>
		<li><strong>Minus:</strong> Cannot catch exceptions thrown by the target page.  
			The system exceptions page will be displayed.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>ActionLink</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Plus:</strong> Able to do work before going to next page (or redisplaying same page).</li>
		<li><strong>Minus:</strong> Generates a component event request, so it does 2 trips to the server.</li>
		<li><strong>Plus:</strong> Context can be baked in when the link is rendered and/or provided dynamically 
			by the event handler method.</li>
		<li><strong>Plus:</strong> Able to catch exceptions and deal with them, eg. by displaying them on the page. 
			However, in practice you would rarely use this because it's unlikely you'd write a target page that 
			throws an exception while you're simply passing it some context info. The target page will have to handle 
			context problems, but it will usually do that later as it renders. This is discussed further in the 
			Handling a Bad Context example.</li>
	</ul>
