	<p>
	The <strong>workout</strong> package contains entities that model many relationship types:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Department is an aggregation of Teachers.</li>
		<li>Building is a composition of Rooms.</li>
		<li>Student has a mandatory association with a Teacher.</li>
		<li>Teacher has an optional association with a Room (the teacher's "favourite" room).</li>
		<li>Building has an optional association with a Room (the building's "main" room).</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="workout_classes.png">
	<p>
	These classes are not really part of the application.  They've been put here solely to give the 
	business layer's persistence and exception handling a "workout" (ie. testing) without 
	disrupting the data in the app's real entities.
	</p>
	<p>
	To give them a workout, run the

	<p>Problems?  Eclipse might not be ready for junit - see

		<li>business/src/test/java/jumpstart/business/commons/exception</li>
	</ul>
