DO NOT MODIFY THE "COLLAPSED" OR "EXPLODED" DIRECTORY

-> The collapsed/ and exploded/ directories in this project are populated automatically by an Eclipse project builder
(open the project's properties and click on Builders - you will see that there is the usual Java Builder plus there are
Ant build files called collapser.xml and exploder.xml which you'll find in the top level of the project).

-> Check that the collapsed/ and exploded/ directories, if they exist, have been flagged as "derived" (open the 
directory's properties and ensure that Derived is on).
